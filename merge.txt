Git Merge is a command used to combine the changes from two branches into one. It integrates work from different branches into a single unified history without losing progress. For example, you can merge a feature branch into the main branch to include all recent updates.

Preserves the complete commit history of both branches.
Performs automatic merges unless conflicts require manual resolution.
Uses fast-forward merge when no diverging commits exist.
Creates a merge commit to combine branch histories when necessary.
Does not delete branches after merging.
Commonly used to integrate feature branches into the main branch.
